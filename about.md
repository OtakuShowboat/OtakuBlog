<p>Hello everyone! I was YouTuber that primarily created Let's Play videos. I changed my name from LPShowboat0099 to Otaku Showboat in order to provide a more diverse array of content outside of just "Let's Play" videos on my YouTube channel. The intent was to produce content not only related to gaming, but to anime, manga, etc. as well! I made videos September 2011, about one month before my father passed away, until September 2017. Making videos pulled me through a terrible time, and even though my content was honestly not particularly great, I am proud of what I managed to accomplish in 6 years. </p>
<p>I completed a Master's of Science in Geology from the University of Kansas in May 2018 and a B.S. in Biological Sciences from Old Dominion University in May 2013.</p>
<p>This blog is where I talk about all of the random subjects I originally had wanted to make videos about - Anime, Manga, Light Novels, Video Games, etc., though it is now basically a standard "everything" blog where I talk about pretty much anything, including my weight loss journey and learning experiences.</p>
