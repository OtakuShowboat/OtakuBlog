<p>Okay, this was a great ending to the arc. A lot of progress is made in the story, too. Honeslty, I'm running out of things that I can really say without spoilers in regards to this series, but I'll try my best.</p>
<p>This time the MCs bring more of the other races into the fold through continuing to beat their games. That's pretty much the premise of the entire series, though this book takes it to perhaps the limit. The MCs face one game that's exciting and full of action and resolve the puzzle of the previous volume, which is <em>unique</em>, to say the least. There's also a bonus game in the Prologue played by a couple side characters which is pretty neat.</p>
<p>Anyway, I did enjoy this novel way more than volume 4, though I am saddened because I don't think the next volume particularly progresses things much. I don't know the details, but I do know that volume 6 is the material used for a prologue movie (No Game No Life Zero). It's unfortunate that we now must wait for volume 7 for actual story advancement. Anyway, I'll be working on 6, and will let you know when I finish it.</p>
