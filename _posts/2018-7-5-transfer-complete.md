excerpt: "The transfer has now been completed!"

<p>The transfer has now been completed! The new site is live pending full DNS updates, which could take up to 72 hours for some people. The old blog with SquareSpace has been deactivated and the domain will not renew there, as I have transferred the domain to namecheap, where I have my portfolio domain. I have also enabled Cloudflare on both this blog and my portfolio site for additional security (also taking up to 72 hours to take full effect).</p>

<p>Now, you may notice that there are quite a few things different from the older SquareSpace install. Bear in mind that things are still a Work in Progress. Comments, the twitter feed, favicons, and pagination are in the works. The goal has been to keep the general feel of the old site while remaking it with Jekyll, which I feel I have managed to do thus far. Once I have all of the features of the SquareSpace install sorted out, I can then consider adding additional functionality. I hope you enjoy the site going forward.</p>
