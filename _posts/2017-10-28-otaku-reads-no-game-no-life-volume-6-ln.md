<p>Well, I’ve finished off volume 6. I was up past 2:00 am last night because of it. It is a wonderful stand-alone story. That said, it should have been just that – stand-alone.</p>
<p>First off, this is a prequel meant to explain the actual events leading to the current state of the world with Tet as the One True God. It does this, and it answers a number of...quite minor questions. That said, I do not feel that this should have been a volume in the main series. It should have been a separate spin-off title (you know, like calling it Zero, as the movie). This story is supremely bleak and full of death and destruction. While the world state at the time is conducive to this type of story, the series thus far is quite literally the polar opposite. Which is why I’m ultimately a bit torn on this one. This story is perhaps the best of the series, but it’s not really part of the series. It is a piece of history that will likely never get any real resolution or much further discussion in the main story from here on out.</p>
<p>So, since volume 7 is not releasing until freaking late February 2018, it’s time to move on to other things. I now have a list of titles that I will be reading set up. Check it out via the top navigation. Up next is Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash Volume 3 (LN). From there, I was hoping to read volume 9 of The Rising of the Shield Hero, but due to delays from the publisher, it may or may not be here in time to be after Grimgar 3, so I have gone ahead and set up the Re:Zero light novels to follow it. I’ve ordered what’s been released that I don’t already have (volumes 2 through 5), so they should absolutely be here in time. So, enough about the future plans. You can see the full list through navigating above. I’ll see you on the next one.</p>
