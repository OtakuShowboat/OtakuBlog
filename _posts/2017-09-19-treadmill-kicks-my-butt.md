<p>The other day I was prepared to take my walk and discovered that it was absolutely dreary. I decided that it would be best to go to my apartment's workout room and take my walk on a treadmill instead.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about treadmills: They don't have intersections and stoplights. I walked 3 miles on it at an average of about 2.7 mph and it completely kicked my butt. My FitBit also does not like the treadmill.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about the FitBit Blaze: The heartbeat sensor HATES sweat and gives completely inaccurate readings while sweating (thus messing up the calorie burn count) AND it does not keep track of steps if you're holding on to a treadmill's handle with that hand, which can be dangerous.</p>
<p>All that aside, when I got up the next morning (yesterday), my legs were so sore that I could not take my walk. This soreness persisted even into today. I did take my walk today, but I cut it shorter than normal due to the pain.</p>
<p>The next time there's rain in the morning and have to use the treadmill, I'm absolutely going to take it a lot easier and stick to a max of 2 miles at 2-2.5 mph.</p>
<p>In other news, I am officially under 350 lbs now. I've fluctuated in the 349 range for a few days now, but that should continue trend down soon enough, especially as I take it a bit easier on walks (fat burn heart rate). The first "milestone" has now been met. The next is 325, though my (rather extreme) ultimate shorter-term goal is to be sub-300 by the time I go home on a flight in mid-December.</p>
