<p>Well, last night I finished off volume 2, and I’m a little conflicted. It is a good read, though it doesn’t advance the story much. </p>
<p>There are effectively two stories here, the first of which appears as if it’s not even necessary in the grander scheme of things. It was an excuse to go in-depth into a completely insane game of words. The volume also ends on a cliffhanger, which is a pain. I hate when authors feel like they need to rely on cliffhangers to get people to buy the next book instead of relying on the strength of the story they’ve told. I mean, there’s not much else for me to say about this one. I enjoyed it, but I also think that a lot of it was superfluous. Volume 1 was a better story. I'll go on and say that I don't feel this volume told a very cohesive story, i.e., it simply cannot stand on its own without Volume 1.</p>
<p>So, with all that said, I have started off volume 3 and will let you know when I finish. That one ends off the content of the anime, and I’m looking forward to getting to new content.</p>
