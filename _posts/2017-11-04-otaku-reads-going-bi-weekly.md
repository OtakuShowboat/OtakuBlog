excerpt: "Starting with this next novel, I will be modifying the release schedule of the Otaku Reads series. Thus far, I have written a post nearly immediately after finishing a book before moving on to the next with no sort of schedule whatsoever. That has now changed. I will now make an Otaku Reads post every two weeks, with the post for Re:Zero volume 1 being on November 18, volume 2 on December 2, etc. This gives me more time to not only read the volume but digest what I've read and write up a more coherent response tempered by a clearer head. See you on the 18th!"
