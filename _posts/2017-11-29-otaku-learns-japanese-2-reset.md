<p>Today I reset my progress on WaniKani back to level 1. I had hit level 12, but had yet to even begin the level 12 content. You may be wondering exactly why I would forsake almost three months of progress. The answer is twofold, and the steps I have taken will result in me actually learning the content a lot more deeply than before. </p>
<p><em>Why I reset</em></p>
<ol>
<li>I cheated. There is a script called WaniKani Override that lets you “try again” on any review. While it is meant to fix dumb spelling errors, I simply could not overcome the temptation to overuse it to the point that I never truly learned a lot of the content from levels 4 through 11. While in recent weeks I had tried not using it, I broke down and started using it again. It was all a big mess. I was overriding content I wasn’t going to see again for four months, so to FIX it and start learning that content, I’d have to deal with waiting four months to get the reviews wrong, then many more weeks after that to see them again and start the process over again. It would take a VERY long time to correct, meanwhile…  </li>
<li>I overdid it on the lessons in the first 10 levels. I was ending up with batches of 160+ reviews a day. While in the last couple of levels I started to not do as many new lessons each day, the damage was done. And the more reviews there are, the more I’d need to rely on the Override script.  </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Steps I’m taking to resolve these issues</em> </p>
<ol>
<li>I am now using a script that completely prevents lessons based on a score of all items you have active if the total score is above 100. This ultimately will result in fewer lesson batches over time until items start getting burned. It will completely prevent overdoing the lessons going forward.  </li>
<li>I have also added a script that puts a time limit on each review response. Default is 10 seconds, though I have set it to 20. Why? There are some items we need to write that are a bit long, so I want time to recall and type those longer items. The idea with this script is that if I can’t recall something in the time limit, I won’t have time to cheat and look up the answer (as I clearly don’t know it).  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What will result</strong>  </p>
<p><em>Pros</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Individual review times will be a lot shorter, as they are now timed.  </li>
<li>Cheating will be nearly impossible because of the time limit.  </li>
<li>I need to actually KNOW the answers or they will be wrong.  </li>
<li>More wrong responses will mean less new lessons each day due to the score system.  </li>
</ol>
<p><em>Cons</em>  </p>
<ol>
<li>It will take a LOT longer to get through all of WaniKani’s content.  </li>
</ol>
<p>So, yes, in the end it will take longer, but I will KNOW what’s being taught, which is the whole point. Reviews will be at a manageable level, and I can actually start living my life without worry about reviews every hour. For now, though, I’m just a level 1 waiting on the next review session.</p>
