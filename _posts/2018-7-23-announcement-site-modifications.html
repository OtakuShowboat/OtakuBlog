<p>I have made a few changes to the blog site that I felt were necessary for now, and added a feature or two.</p>

<p>First off, you will likely notice that the Weight and Videos pages are now gone. I felt that the weight page has run its course, though I will likely move that information into the About page at some point. As for the Videos page, it has been taken down for several reasons, though primarily as I am no longer focusing on video production. The page was also not particularly well optimized, as it was just a big set of embedded video players. The page would be in need of a major overhaul if it were to return.</p>

<p>I have also made changes to the Collection and About pages. The Collection page is now organized into sets of tables with a lot more information than what was previously presented. It is now the go-to place to find out what I own of a series, what I've actually read of a series, and what series I'm currently following. The tables have been designed so that they should appear just fine even with mobile portrait mode. Speaking of which, I have modified the site behavior so that side margins for the main content are removed on screen widths common with portrait orientation in phones and tablets. Lastly, I have added the ability to share posts on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. The links are at the bottom-right of each post, before the Disqus comments section.</p>

<p>To end things off today, I want to just say how wonderful it has been working with Jekyll. While my goal is to eventually start developing with Ruby on Rails, learning the ins-and-outs of Jekyll has been a massive time saver. It makes development fun for me, and I find myself working on my sites during the day instead of doing other things like playing video games. Perhaps more importantly, the more I time I spend working with developing websites, the more kinks I can iron out when it comes to doing it as a profession. Speaking of which, I will be starting off the process to obtain my business license this week. In Norfolk, Virginia, you first need approval for the business location from Zoning, which is a one-time fee, then if the business name does not include the owner's name, a trade name needs to be registered for another one-time fee. Only after that can I apply for the business license, which comes with a yearly minimum fee of $50 in business taxes and on top of that I'll owe business property taxes for the equipment used for the business, which is a little over 4% of 40% of the cost at time of purchase of each itemized item.</p>
