excerpt: Getting through volume 4, I am excited for volume 5. This, I suppose, is
  the utmost goal of any series, though it does not address how I enjoyed the current
  volume. I enjoyed it immensely, and I’m glad to finally have a larger story arc
  moving the main plot ahead.

<p>Getting through volume 4, I am excited for volume 5. This, I suppose, is the utmost goal of any series, though it does not address how I enjoyed the current volume. I enjoyed it immensely, and I’m glad to finally have a larger story arc moving the main plot ahead.</p>
<p>This volume primarily features our MCs getting dragged into a difficult situation to resolve issues with two races (purposely being vague here, by the way). This is the first time the MCs have really faced this specific type of “game,” and do their best at subverting it. The story does NOT have a conclusive ending, sadly, as it continues into the next volume, though does have an exciting climax and some degree of resolution before discussing what still needs to get done. So, yes, it still does have the necessary elements of a story while not resolving the overarching mission. You know, like any GOOD first novel in a series. I particularly enjoyed some of the twists at the end of this one, so am looking forward to getting through volume 5.</p>
<p>Speaking of volume 5, I have started it off, getting a good way into the VERY long prologue. Look forward to that post next. In other news, The Rising of the Shield Hero volume 9 is delayed about another week or two, as sourced from Reddit (so take from that what you will). It’s unfortunate, but these things happen. If it does not arrive by the time I finish off volume 6 of NGNL, I’ll do Grimgar 3, and if it’s not here by the end of Grimgar 3, I guess I’ll do Re:Zero 1. I should really make a list somewhere on the site of the reading order. Watch it happen soon after this gets posted. Anyway, see you all on the next one.</p>
