excerpt: Okay, folks, so I've managed to now sort-of bring back the old main pages
  to the site. While I could add the old posts, I don't see too much point right now.
  I may to some sort of archival post with all the content at some point. We'll see.
  The idea is that I now have my Collection, About, and Video pages up, though the
  Video page in particular has the most changes.

<p>Okay, folks, so I've managed to now sort-of bring back the old main pages to the site. While I could add the old posts, I don't see too much point right now. I may to some sort of archival post with all the content at some point. We'll see. The idea is that I now have my Collection, About, and Video pages up, though the Video page in particular has the most changes. It's now effectively just a selection of playlists from my channel rather than a live widget. May search around for something I can add that will pull in the most recent video on the channel or something. We'll see. Sort of like it being static, though. Want to figure out what other pages I could make for the site. This whole thing is about my brand and a place to share my thoughts and opinions in more than a tweet.</p>
<p>Edit: Now that I'm thinking about it, I'll need to put up a gallery. No use just listing out my collection without proof, now is there?</p>
<p>So, now that things are back to mostly normal, I want to know what any folks visiting this site think! Perhaps the best part of this whole SquareSpace thing is I can add pretty much anything anywhwere, so let's try a simple poll.</p>
