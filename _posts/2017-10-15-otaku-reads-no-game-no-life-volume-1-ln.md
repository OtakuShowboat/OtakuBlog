excerpt: For clarity going forward, light novels will have (LN) and manga will have
  (MN) in the post titles. So, this post is really a day late, but whatever. I sort
  of was up past 1 am reading the entirety of this book the other night. As I was
  going on only about 5 hours of sleep, I clocked out early last night and only read
  the Prologue of volume 2. So, that should give some clear indication as to my thoughts
  on the book.

<p>For clarity going forward, light novels will have (LN) and manga will have (MN) in the post titles.</p>
<p>So, this post is really a day late, but whatever. I sort of was up past 1 am reading the entirety of this book the other night. As I was going on only about 5 hours of sleep, I clocked out early last night and only read the Prologue of volume 2. So, that should give some clear indication as to my thoughts on the book.</p>
<p>I'll note that each volume of No Game No Life is relatively short compared to the other light novel series I own. That said, volume 1 did not have a ton of fluff (say what you will of the pervy scenes) and there isn't a ton of repetition, unlike in some serialized web novels where the author keeps repeating the same things every weekly / monthly chapter for new people yet not bothering to edit that crap out come time to edit together a full volume (I'm looking at you, Log Horizon). The only things that do get repeated are the rules of the world, yet only as they are applied and are more reminders and clarifications rather than explaining them anew.</p>
<p>As this volume is so short, it only features up to the main character's initial rise to power, which is the first third of the anime. That's pretty much what I expected, as the anime goes through volume 3.</p>
<p>There are some differences compared to the anime, with the largest being the climax. The game they play is effectively the same, though I feel that the novel is a better representation. As much as I enjoyed the anime (heck, it was one of the first anime Blu-rays I ever bought), as a whole, I think volume 1 is better. They are both great and engaging, though.</p>
<p>I do want to mention one sort of mind = blown moment I had when I read the Prologue of this volume. The names of the main characters are explained as Sora "White, Empty" and Shiro ("White"). This is based on the kanji for their names, which I just so happen to have learned via Wanikani in the past few weeks. Shiro I knew by heart already, but Sora is a vocabulary reading that was somewhat weak in my mind. This solidified them both. What was MORE exciting was that the book goes on to say that combining the names results in Kuuhaku "Blank." These are the readings I learned with the individual kanji, rather than their vocabulary readings, with Empty being "Kuu" and White being "Haku." So, the Empty White is a blank space, explaining the name of the characters' online persona of " ".</p>
<p>So, yeah, onwards to volume 2 now. I've read the prologue and am continuing with it right after this post goes up. I'll be sure to post again once I've finished it. Oh, and before I forget, volume 5 arrived along with volume 3 of Grimgar. Still waiting on 6 (expected Tuesday) and volume 9 of Rising of the Shield Hero (which releases Tuesday).</p>
