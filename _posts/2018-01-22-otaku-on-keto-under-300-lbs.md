<p>As of December 23rd, 2017, I have been officially under 300 lbs. That was about 18 weeks on the diet, losing 66 lbs. Right now, I'm down to 286.8 lbs after returning from my vacation.</p><p>I have not been this weight since the first time I hit it at some point in either late middle school or early high school, so we're talking in over 10 years. I am glad to have gotten this far in 5 months, and am looking forward to reaching my future goals. Just today I was out shopping for smaller clothes. I bought several pairs of shirts: XL casual long-sleeves, and an XXL buttoned. I used to barely fit XXXL. For pants, I'm wearing size 40 khaki's right now, straight fit, though with flex. I was up to size 50. I also needed a new belt, an XL size 40-44, as my old one was allowing my pants to slide down when on the tightest it could go.</p>
