<p>NOTE: Just a quick word of warning, if you have come here for plot summary or massive spoilers, you have come to the wrong place. This is an impressions series, for the most part, and I give my reactions to the books as a whole.</p>
<p>Okay, so I finished this second light novel volume way faster than anticipated and totally didn't skip over any of it at any point. Really. Especially none of the COMPELLING and INTERESTING internal dialogue of the MC.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Okay, fine, I skipped a bunch of the internal dialogue crap, the majority of which adds jack all to the character anyway. I really do think the author goes out of their way to make you hate the MC.</p>
<p>That said, this is the Kobold arc as I had mentioned last post, so it's basically the rest of the story in the anime. Really, there's not too much different between the two - nothing completely game changing anyway. The final fight was better in the anime, though. Thus far, though, I do think that the anime is just straight-up superior to the content it's based on, purely on the basis of the format being done so well. The best parts of the anime are parts without any words. So much is said without anything being spoken. That's not something that can be done with a book, so instead the author repeatedly over-explains what's going on with emotional states, especially with the MC. It killed the first volume for me and it brings down the second. I have to say, though, that this one is a much better read than the first volume for having already watched the anime. This story arc managed to keep my attention throughout and had me staying up to read "just one more chapter."</p>
<p>With all that said, I am looking forward to the next volume, which...HOLY CRAP IT'S OUT NOW?!?! Well, there's a book that's been ordered. Since I'm not going to sit around and wait for it, I'll move on to the next series on the list, which is the No Game No Life light novel series. I have read the prologue of volume 1 already and am sure that each of these books shouldn't take more than 2-3 days each. I'll be posting about each one as I get to them. Since I've ordered Grimgar 3, I've gone ahead and also ordered 5 and 6 of NGNL (and Rising of the Shield Hero vol 9, too, as it releases the 17th). Look forward to my thoughts on all of these going forward, though I'll say right now that volume 3 of Grimgar will wait until after finishing the NGNL series.</p>
