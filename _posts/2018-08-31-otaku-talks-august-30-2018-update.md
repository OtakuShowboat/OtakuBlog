The month since the last major update has been a busy one, but I'll try and keep things shorter this time around. <br/>
<br />
I managed to finally get my business license from the city, so now I can legally do online service work. That also meant doing a lot of work on the website that was primarily my portfolio site in order to convert it to more of a business site. The website is quite different now, though I have MANY further plans for its continued development, including moving it away from being a static site. The point of the website is to show just what I'm capable of building, right? It, therefore, should be built with a framework that is more advanced than Jekyll. Don't get me wrong, Jekyll is fantastic, but since I need to convince people that I can build something more complex, I need to actually build something more complex and database-driven. The business website may end up being transitioned to a Ruby on Rails app in the future, which would also mean it will no longer be absolutely "free" to host due to needing databases. That should also allow me to learn how to properly use things like AWS.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm looking into other online service opportunities such as transcription, proofreading, and bookkeeping as more stable sources of income. I'll keep you posted as I figure things out.<br />
<br />
I also have started reading through a bunch of new light novel series this month, including: Clockwork Planet (though I'm only half way through volume 1 of 3), Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon (v1-2, which I'm currently reading), The Magic in this Other World is Too Far Behind! (v1-5) and Lazy Dungeon Master (v1). I have additionally been continuing the following series: The Saga of Tanya the Evil (v3), That Time I Was Reincarnated as a Slime (v3), Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?! (v3), Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest (v7), and So I'm a Spider, So What? (v3). As you can see, August has been a very busy reading month, and the collection page will be updated shortly. I have also decided to stop with further volumes of Ragnarok and Average pending additional income. Of course, once I do start getting consistent income from whatever I end up doing, I'll be working on updating the entire collection, not just those two. Looking ahead to September, there are only 4 volumes releasing (that I know of) of series I'm following: The Magic in this Other World is Too Far Behind v6, Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody v6, Overlord v8, and How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom v7. I'll likely do another review of the series I'm reading to see what's releasing when come the end of September in case I'm missing anything. Since there are only 4 releases in September, I should have enough time to finish off Clockwork Planet v1-3 and actually read some of my older stuff I haven't read yet.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I'll keep it shorter for this update this time, and I'll see you on the next one.
