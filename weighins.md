<p>The below is a graph of my current weight loss. The blue line represents the goal loss per week, currently set to <strong>2.5 lbs</strong>. The orange / yellow line is the trend line. If it's below the blue line, I'm losing more than the goal, and if above, less. The red line is the actual weight recorded each day. The green line is the goal set for the graph. The goal will change once I meet it.</p>
<p>Goal (current): 220 lbs <br data-preserve-html-node="true">
